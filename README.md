## About Me

I'm a budding software engineer, interested in machine learning and automation, with a background in science and photography.

I've spent the past 10+ years juggling full-time childcare of my two children with building up a photography business, which has been challenging, to say the least.  I'd never even sold a picture when I started out, let alone brought up kids.

Before this, I spent 13 years in various science-related roles, from water testing and food microbiology, to cell culture and parmaceutical quality control, before securing a position in an academic research team at The Institute of Cancer Research, investigating DNA damage and cancer for 7 years.

With the children now growing up fast and the photography business not really fitting into the demands of family life, I've decided to pursue a career change into computing. I've always had an understanding of computers, despite never having had a formal education in computing. We barely touched a computer when I was in school. But in every job, I've been able to help others with computing problems and identify problems.

So, in a rapidly changing world, moving towards automation and artificial intelligence, it seems like a great time to start learning how to put ideas into practice and start learning to code.

After joining a coding platform and working through various courses for a year, learning about python and javascript, I signed up to study for a Diploma in Full Stack Software Engineering, with The Code Institute.
  
I've learned so much, in such a short space of time, that it's hard to remember it all to be honest, but I do know that nothing teaches you how to code as well as trying it out. Making something work, fixing errors and finding ways to overcome obstacles really advances the learning process.
